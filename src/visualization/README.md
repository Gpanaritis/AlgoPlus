# Data Structure Visualizations

Inside this folder you will find all the code that is responsible for visualizing our implemented data structures. We currently
support three types of data structures: Graphs(Di-Graphs and Graphs), Lists(almost all types of lists that you can find inside classes/)
and Trees(Except for Red-Black trees that is coming soon).
All the visualizations are just .dot files that you can easily view via graphviz
